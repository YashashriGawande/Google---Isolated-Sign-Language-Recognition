# Google---Isolated-Sign-Language-Recognition
The goal of this competition is to classify isolated American Sign Language (ASL) signs.

## Context
Every day, 33 babies are born with permanent hearing loss in the U.S. Around 90% of which are born to hearing parents many of which may not know American Sign Language. Without sign language, deaf babies are at risk of Language Deprivation Syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by a lack of access to naturally occurring language acquisition during their critical language-learning years. It can cause serious impacts on different aspects of their lives, such as relationships, education, and employment.

Learning sign language is challenging. It is as difficult for English speakers as learning Japanese. (jstor.org) It takes time and resources, which many parents don't have.
